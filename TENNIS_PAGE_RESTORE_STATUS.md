# Tennis Holiday Page Restoration Status

## ✅ Sections Restored (as of now):

1. **Hero** - ✅ Present
2. **Breadcrumbs** - ✅ Present  
3. **Tab Navigation** - ✅ Updated with new tab names
4. **Info Section** - ✅ Present with sidebar
5. **Gallery** - ✅ Full-width 3-image layout
6. **The Tennis** - ✅ 3-card carousel with videos
7. **Facilities/Resort Information** - ✅ Tabbed interface
8. **What's Included/Not Included** - ✅ Side-by-side with images

## ❌ Still Missing:

1. **Rooms Section** (id="rooms") - CRITICAL
2. **Itinerary Section** (id="itinerary") - CRITICAL  
3. **Dates & Prices** - Important
4. **FAQs** - Important
5. **Other Destinations** - Nice to have

## Current File Size: ~1,390 lines (was 2,219 originally)

## Next Steps:

Due to the large amount of remaining code, I recommend:

**Option A:** Restore from git history if available:
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- src/pages/tennis-holiday/[slug].astro
git checkout <commit-hash> -- src/pages/tennis-holiday/[slug].astro
```

**Option B:** I continue adding sections incrementally (will take 5-10 more messages)

**Option C:** I provide you the complete missing HTML to copy/paste

The page is functional now with the core sections, but missing the Rooms and Itinerary sections which the tabs link to (causing broken navigation).

Would you like me to:
- Continue adding sections one by one?
- Focus on just Rooms and Itinerary (the critical ones)?
- Provide complete code blocks for you to add manually?
