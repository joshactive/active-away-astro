# URGENT IMAGE FIX - Applied ‚úÖ

## Issue A: Images Not Loading

### Problem
The `extractImageId()` function was extracting incorrect values from Strapi URLs, causing broken image paths like:
```
‚ùå BAD: https://activeaway.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/-aT8Z2F9gGvZ9fdofZcCaQ/activeaway.com/public?width=455...
```

Instead of:
```
‚úÖ GOOD: https://activeaway.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/-aT8Z2F9gGvZ9fdofZcCaQ/3b40f4d8-c0c6-417f-aeef-343af3a69000/public?width=455...
```

### Root Cause
Strapi serves images in two formats:
1. **With UUID**: `https://activeaway.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/-aT8Z2F9gGvZ9fdofZcCaQ/3b40f4d8-c0c6-417f-aeef-343af3a69000/public`
2. **With Path**: `https://imagedelivery.net/-aT8Z2F9gGvZ9fdofZcCaQ/activeaway.com/Sani-Beach-Tennis-Courts.jpg/public`

The function was extracting `activeaway.com/Sani-Beach-Tennis-Courts.jpg` as the "image ID" when it's actually a path.

### Solution Applied ‚úÖ
Updated `extractImageId()` in `/src/utils/cloudflareImages.js` to:
1. Extract the segment after the account hash
2. Validate if it's a proper UUID (format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)
3. If it's a UUID ‚Üí return it for optimization
4. If it's a path ‚Üí return `null` to use the original URL without optimization

**Result**: Images with UUIDs get optimized, images with paths load normally without breaking.

## Issue B: Hero Text Not Centered on All Devices

### Problem
Hero text was positioned at `top-[56%]` on all devices, which didn't account for:
- Smaller navigation bar on mobile
- Different viewport proportions on tablets
- Content appearing off-center on smaller screens

### Solution Applied ‚úÖ
Updated hero content positioning in `/src/components/HeroTailwind.astro`:
```css
top-[52%] sm:top-[54%] lg:top-[56%]
```

**Responsive positioning:**
- **Mobile** (default): `52%` - Accounts for smaller nav bar
- **Tablet** (sm - 640px+): `54%` - Mid-point adjustment
- **Desktop** (lg - 1024px+): `56%` - Original desktop positioning

**Result**: Hero text now appears properly centered between the header and bottom on all device sizes.

## Testing

### Test Image Loading:
1. Check featured locations on homepage
2. Verify blog images load correctly
3. Check hero testimonial avatars
4. All images should load without 404 errors

### Test Hero Positioning:
1. Open homepage on mobile (< 640px)
2. Open on tablet (640px - 1023px)
3. Open on desktop (1024px+)
4. Verify text appears centered between header and bottom on all sizes

## Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/cloudflareImages.js`**
   - Enhanced `extractImageId()` with UUID validation
   - Prevents broken image URLs for path-based Strapi images

2. **`src/components/HeroTailwind.astro`**
   - Added responsive positioning: `top-[52%] sm:top-[54%] lg:top-[56%]`
   - Ensures proper centering across all breakpoints

---

## No Breaking Changes

- ‚úÖ Images with valid UUIDs: Still optimized with responsive sizes
- ‚úÖ Images with paths: Load using original URLs (no optimization but no breaking)
- ‚úÖ Hero positioning: Responsive and centered on all devices
- ‚úÖ All other functionality: Unchanged

The site should now work correctly! üéâ
