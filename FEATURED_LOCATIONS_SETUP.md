# Featured Locations - Quick Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Been Done

### 1. Strapi Files Created

✅ **Schema**: `/Users/joshuathompson/strapi/strapi/src/api/featured-location/content-types/featured-location/schema.json`
✅ **Controller**: `/Users/joshuathompson/strapi/strapi/src/api/featured-location/controllers/featured-location.js`
✅ **Service**: `/Users/joshuathompson/strapi/strapi/src/api/featured-location/services/featured-location.js`
✅ **Routes**: `/Users/joshuathompson/strapi/strapi/src/api/featured-location/routes/featured-location.js`

### 2. Astro Code Updated

✅ **API Function**: `getFeaturedLocations()` added to `src/utils/strapi.js`
✅ **Component Updated**: `LocationsTailwind.astro` now uses dynamic data
✅ **Image Support**: Responsive srcset from Strapi formats
✅ **Fallback**: Hardcoded data if Strapi unavailable

### 3. Documentation Created

✅ **Full Guide**: `FEATURED_LOCATIONS_GUIDE.md` - Complete reference

## 🚀 Next Steps (Do These Now)

### Step 1: Restart Strapi

```bash
cd /Users/joshuathompson/strapi/strapi
npm run develop
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✔ Connected to the database
✔ Loading Strapi
✔ Building the application...
✔ Server started on http://localhost:1337
```

### Step 2: Verify Collection Appears

1. Open Strapi Admin: `http://localhost:1337/admin`
2. Check sidebar - should see **"Featured Locations"**
3. If not there, rebuild admin:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run develop
   ```

### Step 3: Set Permissions

1. Strapi Admin → **Settings** → **Users & Permissions Plugin** → **Roles** → **Public**
2. Scroll to **Featured-Location**
3. Enable:
   - ✅ `find`
   - ✅ `findOne`
4. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Create Test Featured Locations

Create 3 test entries:

#### Entry 1:
- **order**: `1`
- **active**: `true` ✅
- **holiday_type**: `tennis-holiday`
- **tennis_holiday**: Select any published tennis holiday
- **Save** → **Publish**

#### Entry 2:
- **order**: `2`
- **active**: `true` ✅
- **holiday_type**: `pickleball-holiday` (or another type)
- **pickleball_holiday**: Select any published holiday
- **Save** → **Publish**

#### Entry 3:
- **order**: `3`
- **active**: `true` ✅
- **holiday_type**: `junior-tennis-camp` (or another type)
- **junior_tennis_camp**: Select any published holiday
- **Save** → **Publish**

### Step 5: Test Locally

```bash
cd /Users/joshuathompson/active-away-astro
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4322` and check:

1. **Console should show**:
   ```
   📍 Featured Locations loaded: 3
   ```

2. **Carousel should display**:
   - Your 3 selected holidays
   - Correct images
   - Correct titles & locations
   - Correct prices

3. **No console errors**

### Step 6: Deploy to Production

#### Option A: Cloudflare already has latest code

Just restart or wait for next deployment.

#### Option B: Push changes to Git

```bash
cd /Users/joshuathompson/active-away-astro
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement dynamic featured locations from Strapi"
git push
```

Cloudflare Pages will auto-deploy.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Featured Locations" doesn't appear in Strapi

**Solution:**
```bash
cd /Users/joshuathompson/strapi/strapi
rm -rf .cache build
npm run build
npm run develop
```

### Issue: Console shows "No featured locations found"

**Check:**
1. Are entries **published**? (not just saved)
2. Is `active` set to `true`?
3. Are permissions enabled for Public role?
4. Is Strapi running and accessible?

### Issue: Images not loading

**Check:**
1. Holiday entry has image uploaded
2. Image is published
3. Field name matches:
   - Tennis: `mainHeaderImage` or `featuredImageLg`
   - Others: `featuredImage` or `headerImage`

### Issue: "Using fallback locations data"

**This means:**
- Strapi returned empty or error
- Check Strapi is running: `http://localhost:1337/api/featured-locations`
- Check `.env` has correct `STRAPI_URL` and `STRAPI_API_TOKEN`

### Issue: Build fails on Cloudflare

**Check:**
1. Environment variables set in Cloudflare Pages:
   - `STRAPI_URL`: `https://strapi-production-b96d.up.railway.app`
   - `STRAPI_API_TOKEN`: *your token*
2. Strapi is accessible from internet (not localhost)
3. Public permissions are enabled
