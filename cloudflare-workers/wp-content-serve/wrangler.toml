# IMPORTANT: Routes are commented out for initial testing
# Uncomment the appropriate route when ready to deploy to production

# For testing on a subdomain (SAFE - use this first):
# routes = [
#   { pattern = "test.activeaway.com/wp-content/uploads/*", zone_name = "activeaway.com" }
# ]

# For production deployment (ACTIVE):
routes = [
  { pattern = "activeaway.com/wp-content/uploads/*", zone_name = "activeaway.com" }
]

# No R2 bucket binding needed - this worker just proxies to files.activeaway.com
